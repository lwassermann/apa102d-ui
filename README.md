# apa102d - UI

This is some experimentation with the React Eco-System in the context of a Web-UI for [apa102d](https://github.com/schoeppel/apa102d).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Next Steps:
* [ ] Connect with the actual daemon
* [ ] Improve the Parameters to something more intuitive, not relying as much on HTML5
* [ ] Send the whole spec, and not just the changed parameter (including defaults)
