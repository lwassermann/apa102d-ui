# apa102d - UI

This is some experimentation with the React Eco-System in the context of a Web-UI for [apa102d](https://github.com/schoeppel/apa102d).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Next Steps:
* [ ] Start the server on the PI after booting
* [ ] https, then service worker
* [ ] other effects
* [ ] write the introduction
